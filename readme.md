# Docker for Winter CMS

These docker build files are still a work in progress.

## Setup

By default, when the container starts, `artisan winter:up` is executed to complete migrations.

> **Note:** If there is no database on the first run, a random password is generated by Winter. To reset the admin password, run `docker exec -it <container_id> artisan winter:passwd admin` or `docker-compose exec <service> artisan winter:passwd admin`.

### A note about Alpine Linux

Be aware that the default UID/GID for the *www-data* user in alpine is 82 (whereas it is 33 under debian). If you're mounting host directories, you may need to `chmod 82:82` them first.

Some ideas were borrowed from [aspendigital/docker-octobercms](https://github.com/aspendigital/docker-octobercms). I recommend their images for October.
